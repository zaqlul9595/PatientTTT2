Repository for the Patient role in TTT2. Infect others with a terrible disease

<b>How To Play<b><br>
You are a neutral role with a contagious, incurable disease that you can spread to other players.
Infect others by using your cough gadget and watch as they suffer from decreased movement speed, worse vision, and an audible cough.

As the patient, you choose whether to use your sickness to help, or hinder, the innocents. Or infect everyone you see!
