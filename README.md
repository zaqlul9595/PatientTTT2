# PatientTTT2
Repository for the Patient role in TTT2. Infect others with a terrible disease

### How To Play<br>
You are a neutral role with a contagious, incurable disease that you can spread to other players.
Infect others by using your cough gadget and watch as they suffer from decreased movement speed, worse vision, and a cough that jolts the players view.

As the patient, you choose whether to use your sickness to help, or hinder, the innocents. Or infect everyone you see!

### Immunity and its effects<br>
Once the sickness for the player has ended, they receive a slight speed buff, and get fully healed!
This encourages the patient to understand the consequences of coughing on someone and to think twice about who you infect. They may come back stronger to haunt you!
